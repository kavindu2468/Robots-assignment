       Introduction to Robotics and its applications
    </p>

    <p>
        Robotics is an interdisciplinary field that merges engineering, computer science, and technology to create machines
    capable of performing various tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously. These robots are often programmed to perform
    specific tasks, such as assembling products on a factory line, assisting in surgeries, or even exploring distant
    planets. Robotics has opened new possibilities for industries, healthcare, exploration, and personal use, leading to
    innovation in sectors that previously relied heavily on manual labor.

        In recent years, advancements in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and sensor technologies have greatly
    enhanced the capabilities of robots. They are no longer just machines following preset instructions, but autonomous
    systems capable of learning, adapting, and interacting with their environment. From robotic arms in manufacturing to
    drones in agriculture, the world of robotics is rapidly evolving and has become a critical part of modern society.
